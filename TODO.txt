TODO
----
- ajax code in named file for auto preview
- write test code once modules are finalized in proper location; etc

- will code stay in plone.z3cform.buttons or move?

COMPLETED TODO
--------------
- consider using viewlets for 'preview' mode (Save/Edit/Cancel buttons)
- allowing ordering of button override 'buttons'
- change button.py to buttonoverrides.py
- don't resave draft if its the same as last time (ajax validation makes
  lots of calls)

BUGS
----
- when installing example.conference, it has a dependance of plone.app.drafts, but
  plone.app.drafts still seems to need to be manually installed; but other things
  like plone.dexterity do not??
- IStatusMessage (INFO, This is a preview...) sometimes (so far only on the 
  first ++add++/preview save shows the IStatusMessage; not sure why since I 
  can't repeat it unless I reset server and it happens onlt once again (maybe for
  a given content type).  Could have something to do with caching???

BUGS FIXED (I Think)
--------------------
- preview traverser code that uses add view; need to send blank request; then restore
  or save will not work in edit form :)
- info window not working when submitting/canceling from preview; dont know why since
  IStatusMessage is being set by forms
- When in add/preview mode and click on breadcrumb of real content object; the
  IStatusMessage -- '..in preview mode..' still displays (plone 3/plone 4??)
- sometimes in edit; preview will not work yet
- think there may be a bug if trying to view a draft folder when an item draft
  already exists.  fix -- either in drafts.py or plone.app.drafts.dexterity
