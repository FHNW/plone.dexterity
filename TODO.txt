- allowing ordering of button override 'buttons'
- consider using viewlets for 'preview' mode (Save/Edit/Cancel buttons)
- use behaviors subscribers if they work with ++add++ forms
- remove Save / Cancel overrides and use an event subscriber for cancel / add/modify
- ajax code in named file for auto preview
- write test code once modules are finalized in proper location; etc

- will code stay in plone.z3cform.buttons or move?

BUGS
----
- when installing example.conference, it has a dependance of plone.app.drafts, but
  plone.app.drafts still seems to need to be manually installed; but other things
  like plone.dexterity do not??
- think there may be a bug if trying to view a draft folder when an item draft
  already exists.  fix -- either in drafts.py or plone.app.drafts.dexterity
- When in add/preview mode and click on breadcrumb of real content object; the
  IStatusMessage -- '..in preview mode..' still displays (plone 3/plone 4??)
- sometimes in edit; preview will not work yet

BUGS FIXED (I Think)
--------------------
- preview traverser code that uses add view; need to send blank request; then restore
  or save will not work in edit form :)
- info window not working when submitting/canceling from preview; dont know why since
  IStatusMessage is being set by forms
