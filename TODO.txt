TODO
----
- ajax code in named file for auto preview
- will code stay in plone.z3cform.buttons or move?


HACKS
-----
- plone.app.dexterity.behavior.drafts
  value = getattr( widget.value, 'output', widget.value )

  Can't seem to retreive a value from the widget that allows me to inject
  it into the form.  I also tried using IDataConverter(widget).toFieldValue(value)
  with same result of: 
  RichTextValue object. (Did you mean <attribute>.raw or <attribute>.output?)

COMPLETED TODO
--------------
- consider using viewlets for 'preview' mode (Save/Edit/Cancel buttons)
- allowing ordering of button override 'buttons'
- change button.py to buttonoverrides.py
- don't resave draft if its the same as last time (ajax validation makes
  lots of calls)
- dont like plone.z3cform fix (cached) since it would prevent loading maybe
  in unknown circumstances ... try just not allowing the buttons to be
  know as original_buttons if IFace matches...
- write test code once modules are finalized in proper location; etc

BUGS
----
- when installing example.conference, it has a dependance of plone.app.drafts, but
  plone.app.drafts still seems to need to be manually installed; but other things
  like plone.dexterity do not??
- when using ajax validation; currently there is no dependable way to know that the
  ajax validation is sending in the request; therefore if someone clicks on the
  'remove' image radio button; the image will be removed from the draft right away.
  If I can find some way to identify the ajax validater (that the form has not been
  manually submitted by user); then I can add a HACK to prevent this.  May need to
  modify ajax validater code to do this???
- preview button not showing up in TTW content types

BUGS FIXED (I Think)
--------------------
- preview traverser code that uses add view; need to send blank request; then restore
  or save will not work in edit form :)
- info window not working when submitting/canceling from preview; dont know why since
  IStatusMessage is being set by forms
- When in add/preview mode and click on breadcrumb of real content object; the
  IStatusMessage -- '..in preview mode..' still displays (plone 3/plone 4??)
- sometimes in edit; preview will not work yet
- think there may be a bug if trying to view a draft folder when an item draft
  already exists.  fix -- either in drafts.py or plone.app.drafts.dexterity
- IStatusMessage (INFO, This is a preview...) sometimes (so far only on the 
  first ++add++/preview save shows the IStatusMessage; not sure why since I 
  can't repeat it unless I reset server and it happens onlt once again (maybe for
  a given content type).  Could have something to do with caching???
- when 'edit'ing a draft; image does not appear in plone 4
